# SamsungWearableData
This repo provides a R script that reads multiple files from the Human Activity Recognition Smartphone Dataset and obtains tidy data set for analysis. Following steps were performed on the data to obtain a merged data set.

# install and load required r-packages

# Read the activity label

# Read features data

# Read subject from training data set and rename the columns

# Read the activity training dataset, replace the activity codes with activity labels

# Read the training dataset, apply meaningfule column names to all 561 columns

# Create a new column called 'observation_type' to identify all the records from training data set

# Merge data from multiple data frames into a single data frame called 'train.data'

# Now, load data the 'test' dataset
# Read the subject data

# Read the test activity data set, replace the activity codes to meaningful activity labels

# Read the test data, change the column names to meaningful names

# Create a new column called 'observation_type' to identify all the records from test data set

# Merge data from multiple data frames into a single data frame called 'test.data'

# Merge training dataset and test dataset into a single tidy data
